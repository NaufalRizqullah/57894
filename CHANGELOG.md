### Plan
The Plan is making modular core. So when training in kaggle only pull and make some config for dataset (kaggle) and training / inference using only script with args.

## [Unreleased] - 2024-10-03
Build up the app so it can run demo. after that, find out the model is ugly when we tested. so maybe i back to training again.

idk what happen, but when i see the result of training by inspecting image (visualize generate), seems fine. but in interface, run badly.
